    -------------
    This version of code has been updated from the specialist maths 2021 IA1 Assignment
    It is still implementing a leslie matrix based approach, however, the key difference 
    is the code is written in an object oriented formated, ultimatley making the code more 
    efficient and easier to use. 
    A class is created called human. Whilst it may not be nessecary to use a single class in this script,
    this class will be copied and implemented in a greater heiarchy, where many species are created and modelled.
