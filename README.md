# Population-Growth-Calculator
Welcome To the Population Growth Calculator!

This is a respository of resources relating to population modelling. 
Initially this library has been created to provide an efficent method to calculate population growth using 'Leslie Matricies'.
Originally it was implemented for a year 12 maths problem solving and modelling assignment. We given the problem of modelling the effect 
of interstate and internaltional migration within a given state in Australia. The model we had to use for population growth was the Leslie matricies. 
These were developed by Patrick Holt Leslie (1900 - 1972) when he worked with the University of Oxford, studying animal populations. 

This library will grow, implementing different methods of calulating population growth. 
Firstly, the original file will be replicated, however, in an object oriented design (OOD) format.  
In future I hope to: 
- implement more accurate mathematics and modelling technqiues to better predict population behaviour. 
This will extend to many animals, not just humans. This will be made easier through OOD.  
- Create a GUI for the population modelling as an executable file, implementing the more accurate 
model 


To run the original file: 
-------------------------

Requirements 
- python www.python.org for instructions 
- pip installer type into terminal: 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py | python3'
- matplotlib, numpy and art in terminal 'pip install matplotlib numpy art

Install 
- in terminal 'git clone https://github.com/CF1079/Population-Growth-Calculator.git' 
- type 'ls' to view the directories
- type 'cd Population-Growth-Calculator'
- type 'python3 original_script_IA1' to run 

Running 
- follow prompts, detailed documentation will be available through the help menu 


To run the UPDATED version of the original:
-------------------------------------------

Requirements are as above. 

To run new script, download this repository and navigate to it in the 
command line. 

Run the script using python. Type 'python3 original_OO_version.py'.
No on screen instructions are given, to model data, you must enter manually into the
'test_database.csv' and if you wish to have 'dynamic data', please change these factors
when running the script, otherwise leave them as 0.
