# Population-Growth-Calculator
Welcome To the Population Growth Calculator!

This is a respository of resources relating to population modelling. 
Initially this library has been created to provide an efficent method to calculate population growth using 'Leslie Matricies'.
Originally it was implemented for a year 12 maths problem solving and modelling assignment. We given the problem of modelling the effect 
of interstate and internaltional migration within a given state in Australia. The model we had to use for population growth was the Leslie matricies. 
These were developed by Patrick Holt Leslie (1900 - 1972) when he worked with the University of Oxford, studying animal populations. 

This library will grow, implementing different methods of calulating population growth. 
Firstly, the original file will be replicated, however, in an object oriented design (OOD) format.  
In future I hope to: 
- implement more accurate mathematics and modelling technqiues to better predict population behaviour. 
This will extend to many animals, not just humans. This will be made easier through OOD.  
- Create a GUI for the population modelling as an executable file, implementing the more accurate 
model 


To run the original file: 
-------------------------
